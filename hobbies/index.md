# Tabletop games
Jesper is an avid fan of
([Euro-style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame){: class="ext-link"})
 board games and role-playing games, mainly because of the mix of social
play and intellectual stimulation.

He regularly attends
[GothCon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GothCon){: class="ext-link"}; the
largest and oldest gaming convention in Sweden. Additionally, he has previously
been the chairman of a student board game association with over 120 active
members.

# Social dancing

Although almost criminally unskilled at everything musical, Jesper finds a lot
of joy in the swing dances of the early twentieth century.
[Lindy Hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_Hop){: class="ext-link"} is a
favourite, being energetic, playful and improvisational. He dances at
[WCJ](https://wcj.se){: class="ext-link"}.

# Geocaching
Jesper enjoys combining walks with [geocaching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocaching). Many hiking trails are added to by this activity; whether the caches become more interesting milestones or if their locations reveal off-trail gems.
